# 🏨 Single-Hotel Mode — Ideas & Recommendations

> These are planned improvements for when the platform is used in **single-hotel mode** (`singleHotelMode: true`).
> Grouped by theme. Work top-to-bottom within each group.

---

## 🏠 GROUP H1 — Rooms on the Home Page

> Right now the home page shows tours or generic content. When it's a hotel, guests want to see rooms immediately.

- [x] **H1.1 — "Our Rooms" section on the home page**
  - ✅ Carousel of room type cards fetched from the hotel's active room types
  - ✅ Each card: room photo, room name, key features (beds, sqm, max guests), price per night, "Book Now" button
  - ✅ Toggle in Home Page Editor (`roomsSection` visibility, hotel-only)
  - ✅ Position: after Hotel Story section

- [x] **H1.2 — "Starting From" price in the hero**
  - ✅ Below the hero headline: _"Rooms from $X / night"_ using cheapest active room price
  - ✅ Pulls from the hotel's cheapest room type price via `useMemo`
  - ✅ Subtle white/70 text with bold price highlight

- [x] **H1.3 — Quick availability search widget in the hero (hotel mode)**
  - ✅ When `singleHotelMode: true`, hero shows a dedicated hotel availability search box (check-in, check-out, guests)
  - ✅ Standard tours mode shows a new tabbed search widget: "Find a Tour" tab (keyword + destination + type) and "Custom Trip" tab (links to tailor-made)
  - ✅ Both tabs animate in/out using Framer Motion `AnimatePresence`
  - ✅ `HotelSearchBox` wrapped in a clean card with "Check Availability" header bar
  - Files: `src/app/(main)/home-client.tsx`

- [x] **H1.4 — "Book Direct & Save" badge on hero**
  - ✅ Badge/pill with `Tag` icon after the search widget
  - ✅ Configurable text from Home Page Editor (`bookDirectBadge` field in hero section)
  - ✅ Primary-colored with backdrop blur for premium feel

---

## 🎨 GROUP H2 — Home Page UI/UX Improvements

> Visual and experience upgrades that make the site feel premium and convert better.

- [x] **H2.1 — Full-screen video hero background**
  - ✅ Admin pastes a direct .mp4 URL (Cloudinary, S3, etc.) in the Home Page Editor Hero tab
  - ✅ When a video URL is set, a `<video autoPlay muted loop playsInline>` replaces the image slider as the hero background
  - ✅ Falls back to image crossfade slider if no video is set; falls back to gradient if neither
  - ✅ Gradient overlays remain unchanged so text stays readable over both video and images

- [x] **H2.2 — Sticky header with scroll-aware transparency**
  - ✅ Header changed from `sticky` to `fixed` — overlays the hero image
  - ✅ On home page, when not scrolled: header is fully transparent, TopBar and accent bar hidden, nav links white
  - ✅ Once user scrolls past 80px: header becomes solid white with backdrop-blur + shadow
  - ✅ `usePathname()` detects home page vs inner pages
  - File: `src/components/header.tsx`

- [x] **H2.3 — Animated room/feature cards**
  - ✅ Room cards on the home page use `staggerContainer` + `fadeInUp` — each card animates in as the user scrolls
  - ✅ All 4 hotel-mode sections (Amenities, Gallery, Why Book Direct, Location) also use the same stagger pattern

- [x] **H2.4 — Amenities showcase section**
  - ✅ Responsive icon-grid (2–6 cols) showing selected amenities: WiFi, Pool, Spa, Restaurant, Gym, Parking … (16 amenity types)
  - ✅ Admin toggles individual amenities on/off from the Home Page Editor (Amenities tab)
  - ✅ Title & pre-title configurable; falls back to translated defaults

- [x] **H2.5 — Photo gallery / lightbox section**
  - ✅ CSS-grid masonry gallery (first image spans 2×2, rest fill in)
  - ✅ Click-to-enlarge lightbox with prev/next navigation, close button, animated transitions
  - ✅ Admin uploads gallery images from Home Page Editor (Photo Gallery tab, up to 20 photos)
  - ✅ No extra package needed — built with Framer Motion + Next.js Image

- [x] **H2.6 — "Why Book Direct" section**
  - ✅ Full-width primary-color section with 4 benefit cards (icon + title + description)
  - ✅ Default benefits: Best Price Guarantee, Free Cancellation, Instant Confirmation, Exclusive Perks
  - ✅ Fully configurable from Home Page Editor (Why Book Direct tab) — icon name, title, description per benefit

- [x] **H2.7 — Location / map section on home page**
  - ✅ Google Maps iframe embed + hotel address + "Get Directions" button
  - ✅ Admin enters map embed URL, address, and directions link from Home Page Editor (Location tab)
  - ✅ Only shown in single-hotel mode when at least map URL or address is provided

- [x] **H2.8 — Social media feed / Instagram grid**
  - ✅ Static "Follow Us" square photo grid (up to 9 photos, last tile is a branded CTA link when <9 photos)
  - ✅ Admin uploads photos + sets handle, profile URL, platform name from Home Page Editor (Social Feed tab)
  - ✅ Only shown in single-hotel mode when at least one photo is uploaded

## ✨ GROUP H3 — Amazing Features (High Differentiation)

> These features would make the platform genuinely stand out vs. Booking.com and local competitors.

- [ ] **H3.1 — Room comparison tool**
  - Guest can select 2–3 rooms and see a side-by-side comparison table
  - Columns: price, size, beds, view, amenities, included breakfast
  - Helps guests decide without going back and forth between pages
  - "Add to Compare" button on each room card

- [ ] **H3.2 — Special occasion request at checkout**
  - Checkbox at checkout: "Is this a special occasion?"
  - Dropdown: Birthday / Anniversary / Honeymoon / Business trip
  - Text field: "Any special requests?"
  - Saved to booking record — admin sees it and can prepare a surprise (flowers, cake, etc.)
  - Extremely low effort, huge guest satisfaction impact

- [ ] **H3.3 — Add-on services at checkout (hotel mode)**
  - After selecting a room, guest can add: Airport Transfer / Breakfast / Spa Treatment / Early Check-in / Late Check-out
  - These are the hotel's upsell items (already exists as a system — just wire it into hotel checkout)
  - Revenue multiplier: hotels typically earn 20–30% more per booking through add-ons

- [ ] **H3.4 — Room availability calendar on room detail page**
  - Show a mini monthly calendar on each room's page: green = available, red = unavailable
  - Guests can immediately see if their dates work without going to checkout and finding out there
  - Uses existing `room_inventory` data — just needs a visual calendar render

- [ ] **H3.5 — "Best Rate Guarantee" popup / badge**
  - If guest is about to leave (exit intent), show a small popup: "Did you find a better price? We'll match it."
  - On mobile: show as a sticky bottom ribbon instead
  - Converts price-sensitive guests who were going to check Booking.com

- [ ] **H3.6 — Guest review highlights on home page**
  - Pull the top 3 most-liked reviews and show them as a featured testimonial carousel on the home page
  - Show reviewer name, star rating, a quote snippet, and their country flag
  - Admin can pin specific reviews to always appear

- [x] **H3.7 — Seasonal packages / offers section**
  - Admin creates time-limited packages: "Summer Escape — 3 nights + breakfast + airport transfer — $X"
  - Shown as visually prominent cards on the home page with a countdown timer
  - Packages link to a pre-filled checkout (room + upsell items bundled)
  - Extremely effective for revenue during shoulder season

- [x] **H3.8 — "Nearby Attractions" section**
  - A list of nearby landmarks with distance: "Pyramids of Giza — 12 km", "Cairo Airport — 25 km"
  - Admin enters these manually in settings
  - Guests research location before booking — this answers that question on the home page itself

---

## 📱 GROUP H4 — Mobile Experience

> Over 70% of hotel browsing happens on mobile. These fixes are essential.

- [x] **H4.1 — Floating "Check Availability" button on mobile**
  - Fixed bottom bar on mobile showing: **[Check Availability]** button
  - Taps scroll to the availability search widget or open a modal
  - Similar to the "Book Now" bar already on tour detail pages — apply the same pattern to the hotel home page

- [x] **H4.2 — Swipeable room cards on mobile**
  - On mobile, the rooms section becomes a full-width horizontal swipe carousel
  - Each card takes 85% of screen width so it's clear there are more to swipe
  - Much better than a cramped 3-column grid on small screens

- [x] **H4.3 — Click-to-call button in header (mobile)**
  - On mobile, add a phone icon button in the header that triggers `tel:` link
  - Some guests prefer to call rather than book online — make it trivially easy
  - Reads from `settings.contact.phone`

# 📝 Blog — Public Page & Admin Dashboard Improvements

> The blog exists but is very basic. These upgrades turn it into a real content marketing engine — drives SEO traffic and builds trust.

---

## 🌐 GROUP B1 — Public Blog Page (Reader Experience)

> What visitors see at `/blog` and `/blog/[slug]`. Currently it's a plain list — needs to feel like a real travel magazine.

- [ ] **B1.1 — Featured post hero on blog listing page**
  - Show the latest (or admin-pinned) post as a large hero card at the top of `/blog`
  - Full-width banner image, post title, excerpt, author, date, "Read More" CTA
  - Below it: the rest of the posts in a 2 or 3-column grid
  - Currently all posts are shown in the same uniform grid — no visual hierarchy

- [ ] **B1.2 — Post categories / tags**
  - Add `tags` (array of strings) to the blog post schema
  - Show tag chips on each post card and on the post detail page
  - Filter bar on `/blog`: click a tag to see only posts with that tag
  - Examples: "Egypt Tours", "Hotel Tips", "Travel Guides", "Deals"

- [ ] **B1.3 — Estimated read time on post cards**
  - Auto-calculate from word count: `Math.ceil(wordCount / 200)` minutes
  - Show as "5 min read" on the card and at the top of the post
  - Small detail that signals quality content

- [ ] **B1.4 — Author bio section on post detail page**
  - Below the post content: author avatar, name, short bio, social links
  - Admin fills in author info in settings (or per-post)
  - Adds credibility — makes the blog feel written by real people, not a faceless company

- [ ] **B1.5 — Related posts section at bottom of each post**
  - After post content: "You might also like" — 3 posts from the same tag or category
  - Keeps visitors on the site longer (reduces bounce rate)
  - Match by shared tags, fallback to most recent posts

- [ ] **B1.6 — Social share buttons on post detail page**
  - Share to: Facebook / Twitter(X) / WhatsApp / copy link
  - Use native share API on mobile, icon buttons on desktop
  - WhatsApp share is critical for the MENA market — posts spread through WhatsApp groups

- [ ] **B1.7 — Table of contents for long posts**
  - Auto-generate a TOC from `<h2>` and `<h3>` headings in the post body
  - Sticky sidebar on desktop, collapsible accordion at the top on mobile
  - Makes long travel guides scannable and professional

- [ ] **B1.8 — Newsletter / email capture widget**
  - An inline CTA inside or after each post: "Get travel deals in your inbox — enter email → Subscribe"
  - Stores emails in a `subscribers` table per agency
  - Admin can export subscriber list as CSV
  - The blog is where engaged readers are — perfect place to capture emails

- [ ] **B1.9 — Post search bar on `/blog`**
  - A simple text search input at the top of the blog listing
  - Filters posts client-side by title + excerpt as you type
  - Visitors looking for a specific destination tip can find it instantly

- [ ] **B1.10 — "Back to top" button on long post pages**
  - Floating button appears after scrolling 300px, smooth scrolls to top
  - Standard UX for long-form content — tiny effort, big comfort improvement

---

## ✍️ GROUP B2 — Admin Blog Editor Improvements

> What the agency admin sees at `/admin/blog`. Currently a basic form — needs to be a proper CMS.

- [ ] **B2.1 — Rich text / WYSIWYG editor (replace textarea)**
  - Replace the plain HTML textarea with a proper rich text editor
  - Recommended: `@tiptap/react` (lightweight, headless, extensible)
  - Features needed: bold, italic, headings (H2/H3), bullet lists, numbered lists, blockquote, links, images inline
  - The current toolbar buttons likely insert raw HTML — WYSIWYG would be far more usable for non-technical clients

- [ ] **B2.2 — Post scheduling**
  - Add a "Publish At" date/time field
  - If set to a future time, post status is `Scheduled` — becomes `Published` automatically when the time arrives
  - Useful for planning content calendars (publish every Tuesday at 9am)
  - Requires a cron job or Supabase Edge Function triggered by a scheduled task

- [ ] **B2.3 — Post preview (live preview before publishing)**
  - "Preview" button opens the post as it would look on the public blog in a new tab
  - Passes post content via a temporary preview token/session
  - Essential — admins need to see formatting before they publish

- [ ] **B2.4 — Duplicate / clone a post**
  - "Duplicate" button on the post list — creates a draft copy with "(Copy)" in the title
  - Useful for seasonal content: clone last year's Ramadan post and update the dates

- [ ] **B2.5 — Bulk actions on post list**
  - Select multiple posts via checkbox
  - Bulk: Publish / Unpublish / Delete
  - Useful for managing large post archives

- [ ] **B2.6 — Post cover image with crop tool**
  - Current image upload just stores a URL — add an in-browser crop to ensure correct aspect ratio (16:9 for blog hero images)
  - Use `react-image-crop` package
  - Prevents distorted/off-center cover images that look unprofessional

- [ ] **B2.7 — SEO preview card in the post editor**
  - Below the SEO title/description fields in the post form: show a live preview of how the post will appear in Google search results
  - Shows the blue title link, URL slug, and meta description snippet
  - Already popular in WordPress/Ghost — clients expect this

- [ ] **B2.8 — Reading stats per post**
  - Show on the post list/detail: view count, estimated reads, avg time on page
  - Requires a simple view counter: increment a `views` column on each public page load
  - Helps admin know which content performs best

- [ ] **B2.9 — Tags management UI**
  - A separate `/admin/blog/tags` page to create, rename, merge, or delete tags
  - Currently tags would just be freeform — a management UI prevents duplicates like "egypt" vs "Egypt" vs "egypt-tours"

- [ ] **B2.10 — AI blog post improvements**
  - Currently AI generates a post from a topic prompt — extend it with:
    - "Tone" selector: Informative / Inspiring / Promotional / Casual
    - "Target keyword" input (for SEO focus — AI weaves it in naturally)
    - "Word count" selector: Short (400w) / Medium (800w) / Long (1500w)
    - Auto-suggest 5 post topic ideas based on the agency's destination list

---

## 📊 GROUP B3 — Blog Analytics & SEO

- [ ] **B3.1 — Post view counter**
  - Increment `views` on each public post page load (server-side, via a fire-and-forget API call)
  - Display view count in the admin post list: "1,234 views"
  - Use a debounce / session check to avoid counting refresh spams

- [ ] **B3.2 — Most popular posts widget on blog listing page**
  - A sidebar or section: "Most Read This Month" — 5 posts ranked by views
  - Drives traffic to popular content instead of only showing chronological order

- [ ] **B3.3 — JSON-LD structured data on blog posts**
  - Add `Article` schema to each post page: `headline`, `image`, `author`, `datePublished`, `publisher`
  - This is a direct SEO signal — Google uses it for rich results (author name, publish date shown in search)

- [ ] **B3.4 — Automatic internal linking suggestions**
  - When writing a post in the editor, detect when a tour name or destination is mentioned
  - Show a suggestion: "Link 'Cairo Pyramids Tour' to its tour page?"
  - Improves SEO (internal links) and UX (readers can book directly from a blog post)

---

## ✅ Hero Section Overhaul (Bonus — not originally in checklist)

- [x] **Hero full-bleed layout** — hero section extends 100vw using `w-screen ml-[calc(50%-50vw)]`, visually filling the entire viewport regardless of container constraints
- [x] **Hero extends under the fixed header** — negative top margin `mt-[-84px] md:mt-[-134px]` makes the hero start at y=0
- [x] **Tabbed search widget for tours mode** — "Find a Tour" tab (keyword + destination + tour type + search) and "Custom Trip" tab (personalized trip CTA), animated with Framer Motion
- [x] **Improved hotel mode search** — dedicated card with "Check Availability" header and `HotelSearchBox`
- [x] **Hero subtitle styling improved** — clean text without heavy glassmorphism pill
- [x] **Eyebrow badge** — "Discover & Explore" / "Luxury Stays" badge above the title
- [x] **Stats bar** — 500+ Tours · 50+ Destinations · 10K+ Happy Travelers, fully translatable
- [x] **Slideshow indicator dots** — clickable dots when hero has multiple images
- [x] **Ken Burns effect on hero images** — scale 1.04 → 1 on image transition
- [x] **Added 10 new translation keys** across all 5 locale files (hero.discover, hero.findATour, hero.customTrip, hero.searchTours, hero.customTripTitle, hero.customTripDesc, hero.statTours, hero.statDestinations, hero.statTravelers, hero.checkAvailability)

# 🛎️ Services Page & Upselling — Public + Admin Improvements

> The services/upsell system exists but is underused. These upgrades turn it into a real revenue engine — both on the customer-facing services page and inside the admin panel.

---

## 🌐 GROUP SV1 — Public Services Page (Customer Experience)

> Currently `/services` shows a plain list of upsell items. It should feel like a proper services catalogue that makes guests want to add extras.

- [ ] **SV1.1 — Category-based layout on services page**
  - Group services by category: Airport Transfers / Tours & Excursions / Spa & Wellness / Food & Dining / Equipment Rental / etc.
  - Each category has a heading + icon, services listed below in a card grid
  - Currently all items are dumped in a flat list — grouping makes scanning 10x easier
  - Admin assigns a category to each upsell item in the dashboard

- [ ] **SV1.2 — Service detail modal / page**
  - Clicking a service card opens a modal (or dedicated page) with:
    - Full description, multiple images, inclusions list, exclusions, duration, what-to-bring
    - Pricing breakdown (per person / per group / flat fee)
    - "Add to Cart" button directly from the modal
  - Currently there's no way to see more details about a service — just a card with a price

- [ ] **SV1.3 — "Add to Cart" directly from services page**
  - Each service card has an "Add" button that adds the item to the cart without navigating away
  - Show a quantity selector (+/−) on the card after adding — guests can increase quantity in-place
  - Currently upsell items are only added from the cart page — customers don't think to go back there

- [ ] **SV1.4 — Service availability indicator**
  - Show a badge on each card: "Available Today" / "Book in Advance" / "Sold Out"
  - Based on stock/inventory field on the upsell item
  - Creates urgency and sets expectations

- [ ] **SV1.5 — "Most Popular" / "Recommended" badges**
  - Admin can flag 1–3 items as "Most Popular" or "Staff Pick"
  - These items show a highlighted badge and appear first in their category
  - Social proof within the services catalogue drives more adds

- [ ] **SV1.6 — Bundle / package deals section**
  - A dedicated section at the top of the services page: pre-built bundles
  - Example: "Romance Package — Airport Transfer + Spa + Breakfast — Save 20%"
  - Admin creates bundles by grouping upsell items and setting a bundle price
  - Bundles added to cart as a single item

- [ ] **SV1.7 — Services page hero / intro section**
  - A short hero at the top of `/services`: headline, subtext, optional background image
  - "Enhance your stay with our curated add-on services"
  - Admin edits this text from general settings or page settings
  - Currently the page starts abruptly with cards — no context for first-time visitors

- [ ] **SV1.8 — "Frequently Bought Together" on tour/hotel detail pages**
  - Below the booking form on tour and hotel pages: "Guests also add..."
  - Shows 2–3 relevant upsell items based on destination or category targeting
  - Uses the existing `targeting` logic on upsell items — just needs a better UI placement

---

## 🔧 GROUP SV2 — Admin Upsell Item Management

> What the agency admin sees at `/admin/upsell-items`. Needs much better tools for creating, organizing, and measuring upsell performance.

- [ ] **SV2.1 — Add category field to upsell items**
  - New field in the upsell item form: Category (dropdown or free text with suggestions)
  - Pre-set options: Airport Transfer / Tours & Excursions / Spa & Wellness / Food & Dining / Equipment Rental / Other
  - Enables the category-based layout on the public services page (SV1.1)
  - Supabase: add `category` column to `upsell_items` table

- [ ] **SV2.2 — Multiple images per upsell item**
  - Currently upsell items likely have one image — allow up to 5
  - Shown as a mini carousel in the service detail modal
  - Helps customers see exactly what they're getting (e.g., photos of the spa room, the transfer vehicle)

- [ ] **SV2.3 — Rich description editor for upsell items**
  - Replace the plain textarea with the same WYSIWYG editor used for blog posts (TipTap)
  - Allows: bullet lists for inclusions/exclusions, bold highlights, embed a photo inline
  - Non-technical admins struggle with plain text for service descriptions

- [ ] **SV2.4 — Inclusions & exclusions fields**
  - Separate structured fields: "What's Included" and "What's Not Included" (list of bullet points)
  - Shown clearly in the service detail modal with ✅ / ❌ icons
  - Reduces support questions: "Does the airport transfer include luggage handling?"

- [ ] **SV2.5 — Stock / inventory tracking per upsell item**
  - Optional `stock` field: leave blank for unlimited, set a number for limited items (e.g., "Only 3 spa slots available today")
  - Stock decrements when item is added to a confirmed booking
  - Show "Only X left" badge on the services page card

- [ ] **SV2.6 — Upsell item performance stats**
  - On the upsell items list in the admin: add columns for "Times Sold" and "Revenue Generated"
  - Calculated from confirmed bookings that contain the item
  - Admins can see which services guests actually buy — invaluable for decisions on what to create more of

- [ ] **SV2.7 — Duplicate upsell item**
  - "Duplicate" button on each item — creates a copy with "(Copy)" in the name
  - Useful for creating seasonal variants: "Airport Transfer (Peak Season)" vs "Airport Transfer (Standard)"

- [ ] **SV2.8 — Sort / reorder upsell items**
  - Drag-to-reorder list in the admin — controls the display order on the public services page
  - Currently order is presumably by creation date — admin should control what appears first

- [ ] **SV2.9 — "Featured on Home Page" toggle**
  - Checkbox on each upsell item: "Show on home page in services spotlight"
  - Feeds a "Our Services" section on the home page (new section, see SV3.1)
  - Admin picks 3–6 top services to highlight without showing the full catalogue

- [ ] **SV2.10 — Upsell targeting improvements**
  - Currently targeting is: specific destinations or specific tour IDs
  - Extend to also target: **hotel bookings only**, **tour bookings only**, **any booking over $X**, **specific room types**
  - Example: show "Late Check-out" service only when a hotel room is in the cart

---

## 🏠 GROUP SV3 — Services on the Home Page

> Services are almost never discovered unless a guest stumbles on the /services page. Bringing them to the home page massively increases add-on revenue.

- [ ] **SV3.1 — "Our Services" spotlight section on home page**
  - A 3–6 card section on the home page (between hotels and testimonials)
  - Shows only items flagged as "Featured on Home Page" (see SV2.9)
  - Each card: icon or image, service name, one-line description, price, "Add to Cart" button
  - "View All Services →" link at the bottom
  - Admin controls this section visibility from the Home Page Editor

- [ ] **SV3.2 — Services highlight in checkout sidebar**
  - On the checkout page, in the right sidebar (below the order summary): "Enhance your booking"
  - Shows 2–3 relevant upsell items based on what's in the cart (destination/tour targeting)
  - Currently upsell is shown on the cart page — checkout is the highest intent moment, show them here too

---

## 📊 GROUP SV4 — Upsell Analytics

- [ ] **SV4.1 — Upsell revenue card on admin dashboard**
  - Add a new stat card to the admin dashboard: "Add-on Revenue This Month"
  - Sum of revenue from all upsell items in confirmed bookings for the current month
  - Shows the admin the value of their upsell catalogue at a glance

- [ ] **SV4.2 — Top-selling services widget on dashboard**
  - A small ranked list on the dashboard: Top 5 services by revenue this month
  - Name / units sold / revenue
  - Shows which services warrant more promotion or new variants

- [ ] **SV4.3 — Cart abandonment tracking for upsell items**
  - Track how often a upsell item is added to cart vs actually confirmed in a booking
  - "Add-to-cart rate" vs "conversion rate" per item
  - If an item is added often but rarely confirmed, it may have a pricing problem

---
